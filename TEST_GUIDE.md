## 3. API & Functional Checklist

- [ ] **Authentication**:
    - Accessing `/admin/dashboard` as Student redirects to Unauthorized.
    - Accessing `/scholarships` without login works (Public).
- [ ] **Forms**:
    - Empty required fields show validation errors.
    - Invalid email format is rejected.
- [ ] **File Upload**:
    - Uploading non-PDF/Image files (if restricted) shows error.
    - File size limits (if configured) are enforced.
- [ ] **Data Persistence**:
    - Refreshing the page after Profile Update retains changes.
    - Refreshing Dashboard shows correct Application status.
- [ ] **Smart Features**:
    - "Eligible Scholarships" filter correctly hides scholarships where GPA < minGPA.

## 4. Troubleshooting

*   **Email Failed?**: Ensure `EMAIL_USERNAME` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are set in `.env` for a valid Gmail account (App Password required) or SMTP service.
*   **Upload Failed?**: Ensure `uploads/` directory exists in backend or Cloudinary credentials are correct.
*   **Login Issues**: Restart backend to ensure Seed script changes are loaded.
